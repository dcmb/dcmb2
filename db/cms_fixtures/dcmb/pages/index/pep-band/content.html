Pep Band
========

In the winter we have pep band instead of marching band. The
pep band plays at men's and women's hockey and basketball games -
typically one each weekend. In addition to our usual players, the
athletics department has provided a place for us to have a drum
set and guitars.

Without the need to write and rehearse a show each week, and
because hockey and basketball games are shorter than football
games, pep band is even less time consuming than marching
band. People who did not play in the fall are always welcome to
join us in the winter. Rehearsals are 4:00 to 6:00 every Wednesday!
